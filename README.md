# Horiseon

This read me file will shows my contribution to the horiseon website.

1)My first contribution to the Horiseon website is that i have commented on all the css code. I have explained what each line does and what impact it has on the final webpage. This is a great contribution as future developers who would like to work on the horiseon webpage will find it easy to find bugs, add and remove certain part of the css code.
2)The second contribution i have done for the Horiseon webisit is that i have added semantic tags, the semantic tags in the html file makes it clear what each part of the code does and where it is located on the page, the original Horiseon webpage conntained non semantic tags which made the code hard to read and even though it was functional. I also added alt tags for accessibilty purposes, these alt tags would be benifically for people who are visually impared and are using screen readers. it would help them naivate on the website.
